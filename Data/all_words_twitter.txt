i
mean
it
's
bad
for
the
future
.
this
virus
is
obviously
intent
on
creating
variants
very
quickly
,
each
more
transmissible
than
the
last
,
and
ultimately
one
that
will
not
be
able
to
be
stopped
by
vaccines
.
well
,
depending
on
your
view
of
humanity
i
guess
that
could
be
good
news
.

have
this
right
:
no
q
drops
in

year
so
they
are
referencing
one
from
2017
telling
them
to
watch
rt
at
the
very
time
the
russia
investigation
was
getting
started
?
so…trump
wasn

working
with

for
putin

he
does
as
past
presidents
has
by
talking
with
the
press
as
needed
.
trump
just
liked
the
attention
.
he
wanted
to
be
treated
as
putin
with
everyone
bowing
down
and
praising
him
.
and
yes
,
when
he
spoke
with
the
press
he
was
nothing
but
a
joke
.

kills
me
that
these
cultists
think
that
the
worst
thing
trump
did
was
mean
tweet
.
how
about
compulsively
lying
,
and
golfing
?
how
about
siding
with
putin
over
his
own
intelligence
agencies
?
ignoring
bounties
on

soldiers
?
no
wall
,
healthcare
,
infrastructure

screw
nato
!
!
it
's
just
the
13
families
trying
to
start
ww3
,
which
putin
is
too
smart
to
fall
for
.
besides
``
maybe
''
putin
is
protecting
ukraine
from
illegal
nato
entry
to
steal
proof
of

how
do
you
claim
to
know
what
putin
wants
?
!
enough
with
the
conspiratorial
talk
.
he
says
nato
is
a
threat
.
he
lays
out
why
and
it
makes
complete
sense
.
its
not
complicated
!
re
the
ukr
regime
.
it
is
not
a
democracy
.
democracy
died
in
ukr
in

we
have
a
modern

example
of
what
happens
when
you
bide

come
true
when
the

collapsed
.
“

30

ready
to
roll

trump

nothing

nothing

there
are
so
many

because
1.
they
like

there

out

with

we

at

i
fear
putin
believes
the
western
response
to
a
new
invasion
of
#
ukraine
would
be
weak
,
that
countries
like
the

fear
foreign
military

,
that
foreign
affairs
play
poorly
with
western
electorates
.
he
may
believe
#
russia
can
withstand
the
consequences
.
i
am
not
100
%
confident
that
the
biden

,
eu
,
or
nato
can
prevent
a
new
wave
of
war
.
but
i
'm
also
not
sure
the
maximum
plausible
move
would
either
.
the
question
will
be
how
much
putin
is
willing

sacrifice
.
i
hope
that
fear
of
casualties

sanctions
will

that

radical
trump
dictatorship

will
eliminate

,
which
is
what
the

says
he

it

the
biggest
problems
we
face
as
a
country
is
people
put
real
issues
aside
and
vote
party
which
has
never
done
any
good
for
country
.
the
truest
statement
ever
right
now
is
be
careful
what
you
ask
for
,
many
gop
want
a
putin
type
government
that
's

today

putin

in

if

is
turned
into
a
ticking
bomb
,
russia
may
have
to
strike
to
diffuse
the

.
like
jfk
did
,
he
is
warning
all

that
russia
is
highly
menaced
by

if

is
it
true
that
barack
and
hillary
caused
a
coup
in
ukraine
,
kicking
out
the
good
guys
and
putting
in
place
the
black
hats
?
so
,
does
putin
know
this
and
wants
to
put
back
into
office
the
good
guys
(
white
hats
)
?
i
heard
this
yesterday
...
russia
:
in
the
most
recent
levada
centre
poll
,
incumbent
president
vladimir
putin
(
~epp|ecr|id
)
got
47
%
of
voters
'
support
:
lowest
score
since
2007.
in
an
election
it
would
be
his
lowest
result
,
and
see
him
compete
in
a
second
round
for
the
first
time
.

teď
už
stačí
jenom
pár

a
bude
poražen

a
jeho

tak
podobný
stalinovu
bude
svržen
a
zničen

since
the
peace
has
been
kept
so
far
with
such
proximity
to
russian
borders
then
we
can
keep
it
in
the
future
too
.
unfortunately

putin

got
a
'ukraine

all
the

they
provided

are

previously

@

it

a

might
not

it

so
...
the
media
lied
about
trump
being
a
super-secret
russian
spy
,
controlled
directly
by
putin
,
because
they
wanted
to
help
trump
win
?
whatever

@

i
agree
with
eric
;
the
trumps
are
too
dumb
to
collude
with

,
but
putin
is
n't
too
dumb
to
collude
with
them
against

the
``

is
excruciatingly
detailed
in
a
1400
word
piece
that
notes
how
putin
's
brinkmanship
has
been
rewarded
with
summitry
and
now
floats
from
the
admin
about
territorial
concessions
in

which

there

fake
news
from

evil
capitalist

imperialist
west
.
they
will
stop
at
nothing
to
make

look
bad

putin
's
main
difference
with

is
that

not
allow

the

looks
more
like

1.
gazprom

yes

and
putin
knows
,
which
is
why
there
's
a
focus
on
increased
economic
integration
with
china
,
as
a
means
of

amassing

it

about

you
are

to

keep
his
advices
and
opinions
for
someone
else
.

well
both
xi
&
amp
;
biden
have
had
recent
video
meetings
with
putin
.
the
one
between
biden
was
not
published
,
but
you
can
get
the
gist
of
it
from
western
propaganda
media
.
the
one
between
xi
and
putin
is
on
youtube
via
cgtn
,
&
amp
;
this
article
pretty
much
confirms
what
was
said
on
video
.

putin

of
